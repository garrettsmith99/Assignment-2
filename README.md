# Assignment-2

Seattle Ghoul 

I want my game to be a character who walks around and collects power ups to add power to her staff. So you have different powers to shoot ice or create fire blasts to destory the enimies with. I want to create an open field for my level and then a castle you have to enter through to progress further into the game. I want my character to have to jump over objects and land on switches to activate doors opening and new pathways for my game. I want to add a lot of programming to my game so my characters can move around and be unique.
