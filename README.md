I want my game to be a character who walks around and collects power ups to add power to her staff. So you have different powers to shoot ice or create fire blasts to destory the enimies with. I want my character to have extra weapons such as smaller swords, bottles of magic to throw on the ground. I want there to be spell books you can find and have to type in the game to use. Such as magic spells to defeat new enimies, the power of levitation that only lasts for a little bit. I want my character to go around and collect bags of money to be able to buy stuff at an in game store that im going build. To be able to buy new weapons and extra life points and rare items. I want to create an open field for my level and then a castle you have to enter through to progress further into the game. I want my character to have to jump over objects and land on switches to activate doors opening and new pathways for my game. I want to add a lot of programming to my game so my characters can move around and be unique. My game is going to be a first person point of view and my character is going to go around the dugeons to try and unlock secret weapons and defeat enimies. I want my character to try and find mushrooms and viles of potion to use as health points.
