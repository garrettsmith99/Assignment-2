City Escaper

Roxanne is trying to escape dead city. Running up and down the city. Hordes of people gathering from the maddness. She must keep herself unharmed in the big city. 

With a gun in Roxannes hand she must make it to end. On the street corners people offering 19th century medicine because the future is the apoycolspe shooting enemies

around with her guns. My character must take her guns and shoot to stay alive. She must find secret power ups for her weapon. New bullets for her universal ray gun 

that was built in the year 3022. Roxanne walks around collects power ups adds new power to her gun. Shoot ice or fire bullets. Ice bullets are needed to kill the 

robots. Fire bullets are needed to kill the skeletons. To have a magic belt that glows up when you say the words magic man that allows you to choose more weapons 

daggers, throwing knives, bottles of holy water. Roxanne has to go around the world of New, New York City and read ancinet hieroglyphic pages in an old pryamid found 

in the New York City Anicent Pryamid museum. to find the hints necessary to advance. 

Game Mechanics - I want my character to carry around a gun. Shoot enemies while doing backflips in the air. To atack enemies ith the click of a mouse. around to 

attack a enemy with mouse click.  When you right click the mouse you will be able to attack with a magical staff. I want my game to be basic starting out. To be able 

to attack characters with her weapon. Such as magic spells to defeat new enimies, the power of levitation that only lasts for a little bit

I want to add a lot of programming to my game so my characters can move around and be unique. My game is going to be a first person point of view and my character is

going to go around the dugeons to try and unlock secret weapons and defeat enimies.

Game Lore - I want my game to stand out by being able to collect power ups and other in game items to strengthen her magical abilities with computer programming. 

Writing scripts to allow to collect power ups and new magical abilities.  I want my character to try and find mushrooms and viles of potion to use as health points. 

These health potions will replenish her strength so she doesnt run out of health points. I want there to be spell books you can find and have to type in the game to

use. I want to be able to control how fast she moves around with scripting and how high she can jump. Like a 3D instruction menu that shows you how to play and you 

can hide the popup if you dont want it. I wan their to be a lot of important cutscenes where Roxanne interacts with the other characters and they give her hints on

what to do next in the game.

Game Play - The first level has to manuvuer around the city and solve a puzzel to get to the next level. In the second level of my game there will be an army of 

skeltons and robots she has to defeat in order to move forward in the game, but the twist is the skeltons and robots are the surrviors of the city. The third level in 

the game she has to defeat the boss of the game.  I want my character to go around and collect bags of money to be able to buy stuff at an in game store that im going

build. To be able to buy new weapons and extra life points and rare items. I want to create an open field for my level and then a castle you have to enter through to

progress further into the game. I want my character to have to jump over objects and land on switches to activate doors opening and new pathways for my game.

Main Character - Roxanne 

In order to win the game the player must beat the highscore she has to kill a certain amount of robots in a certain amount of time or else you fail the game. There is

going to be a time limit in the game. You have to defeat a certain amount of enemies in a certain amount of time or else the machines win.  The power ups Roanne will

collect will make her laser gun more powerful, the second power up will give her faster speed and the third power up will give her an advanced shooting technique. 

This game will need a reason to be fun, something that 3D games dont have. A reason for the quest why she goes around killing robots and collectiing bags of money. 

The more bags of money you find in the game the better the prices will be to use the in game money to buy new upgrades and clothing for your character. I need a 

reason why my game stands out from other 2D games, yeah my character moves around on a background but why? My character Roxanne needs a reason why she has to defeat 

all the robots and collect a lot of money. So she can build new weapons and armory to defeat the robots in her game so she has to collect a lot of money until she can 

afford to upgrade her arsenol, then once her armor is ready she be able to take on the final boss. Once she has the best weapons and armor. All the spells she has to 

collect in the game and she be ready to fight the boss.
